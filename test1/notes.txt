test1
this works but uses a gh oauth key and the travis deploy to gh_pages rule

The oauth has problems as noted in test2
the gh pages deploy uses git push --force so _wipes
the entire website_ each time so the tr-out website _only_ has the
files generated here. So no use for updating one directory in a larger
site.
