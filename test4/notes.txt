this works ussing ssh key

The code now explicitly clones the original website, updates the
generated files, commits and pushes the result.

Now installs and caches texlive 2017 (basic scheme) if it is not
already cached.

To get ssh working
1 create a new ssh-key using ssh-keygen do not supply a passphrase
2) find two characters not in the private key (I used @ and #)
3) edit a copy of the private key replacing space by # and newline by @
   to get a single line version.
   add this as a secure variable in the travis config.
4) in the script do the following to install an unreadable
   version of the private key in the .ssh directory in the travis VM
if [ ! -d ~/.ssh ]; then
mkdir ~/.ssh
fi
echo "$omtravis2" | sed -e 's/@/\n/g'| sed -e 's/#/ /g' > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod og-wrx ~/.ssh/id_rsa

With this in place the target git repository can be cloned out and pushed
over ssh
